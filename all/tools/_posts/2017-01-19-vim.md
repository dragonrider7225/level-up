You are going to have to use `Vim` sooner or later while trying to get something done on some Linux box, so get capable on it.

I have been using Vim since sometime before I started learning Haskell, which was itself sometime before 2017-01-19, when I started working on my mostly abandoned todo list project in Haskell.
